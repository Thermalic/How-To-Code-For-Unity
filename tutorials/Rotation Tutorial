Step 1: Setting up the Scene
- Open Unity and create a new 3D project.
- Add a 3D object to the scene. For example, you can use a sphere or a cube.

Step 2: Creating the Script
- Right-click in the Project panel, then go to Create > C# Script.
- Name the script "ObjectRotation" and double-click it to open in your code editor.

Step 3: Writing the Script
- Inside the ObjectRotation script, create the following variables under the { :

using UnityEngine;

public class ObjectRotation : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The object to rotate towards
}

Step 4: Creating The Rotation Part
You might notice this under your variable

void Start().

Hover your mouse over the "Start" Text.

Then Delete the Update Text.

Once deleted replace the Update with :

void Update()
Instead.

This will constantly do something each frame.

Step 5: Adding the Part Itself

Now your script should look something like this.

using UnityEngine;

public class ObjectRotation : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The object to rotate towards

    void Update()
    {

    }
}

Under the { under void Update() Type in "If () {}" and click enter.

if ()
    {
            
    }

This is what it should look like so far.

Inside of the () Type In target != null.

This will check if the Target Variable is invalid, and if so it will not do anything, so errors don't get caused.

Step 6: Rotating the Object
- In the middle of the { and } type in the following:

if (target != null)
{
    Vector3 targetDirection = target.position - transform.position;
    Quaternion targetRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(targetDirection, Vector3.up);
    transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(transform.rotation, targetRotation, Time.deltaTime);
}

This should complete the script.

Step 7: Saving
- Save the script by pressing the save button usually on the top or a file icon button.

Step 8: Assigning the Target
- In the Inspector panel, assign the "Target" variable of the ObjectRotation script to the GameObject you want to rotate towards.

Step 9: Testing the Rotation
- Press the Play button in Unity and observe how the object smoothly rotates towards the target.

That's it! You've created a simple script that allows an object to smoothly rotate towards another object in Unity.
