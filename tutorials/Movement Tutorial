Movement Script

In this tutorial, we will create a basic script in Unity that enables an object to move towards another object. This is perfect for beginners who want to learn how to code movement behaviors in Unity.

Step 1: Setting up the Scene
- Open Unity and create a new 3D project.
- Add two 3D objects to the scene. For example, you can use a sphere and a cube.

Step 2: Creating the Script
- Right-click in the Project panel, then go to Create > C# Script.
- Name the script "ObjectMovement" and double-click it to open in your code editor.

Step 3: Writing the Script
- Inside the ObjectMovement script, create the following variables under the { :

using UnityEngine;

public class ObjectMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The object to move towards
---------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Creating The Movement Part.

You might notice this under your variable

void Start().

Hover your mouse over the "Start" Text.

Then Delete the Start Text.

Once deleted replace the start with :

void Update() 
Instead.

This will constantly do something each frame.

Step 5: Adding the Part Itself.

Now your script should look something like this.

using UnityEngine;

public class ObjectMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The object to move towards

    void Update()
    {
    
    }
}

Under the { under void Update() Type in " If() {} and click enter.
 if ()
    {
            
    }
This is what it should look like so far..

Inside of the () Type In target != null.

This will check if the Target Variable is invalid, and if so it will not do anything, so errors dont get caused.

After you do that it should look like this.

if (target != null)
{

}

-------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Transforming
- In the middle of the " { & } type in " transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position, target.position, Time.deltaTime);"

This should complete the script, making it look like this! 

using UnityEngine;

public class ObjectMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The object to move towards

    void Update()
    {
        if (target != null)
        {
            transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position, target.position, Time.deltaTime);
        }
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------
Step 7: Saving 
- Save the script by pressing the save button usually on the top or a file icon button.

--------------------------------

Step 8: Assigning the Target
- In the Inspector panel, assign the "Target" variable of the ObjectMovement script to the GameObject you want to move towards.

Step 9: Testing the Movement
- Press the Play button in Unity and observe how the object moves towards the target.

That's it! You've created a simple script that allows an object to move towards another object in Unity.
