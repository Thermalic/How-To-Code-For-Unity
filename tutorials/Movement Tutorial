Movement Script

In this tutorial, we will create a basic script in Unity that enables an object to move towards another object. This is perfect for beginners who want to learn how to code movement behaviors in Unity.

Step 1: Setting up the Scene
- Open Unity and create a new 3D project.
- Add two 3D objects to the scene. For example, you can use a sphere and a cube.

Step 2: Creating the Script
- Right-click in the Project panel, then go to Create > C# Script.
- Name the script "ObjectMovement" and double-click it to open in your code editor.

Step 3: Writing the Script
- Inside the ObjectMovement script, create the following variables:

using UnityEngine;

public class ObjectMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The object to move towards

    void Update()
    {
        if (target != null)
        {
            transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position, target.position, Time.deltaTime);
        }
    }
}
```

Step 4: Adding the Script to an Object
- Drag and drop the ObjectMovement script onto the GameObject that you want to move.

Step 5: Assigning the Target
- In the Inspector panel, assign the "Target" variable of the ObjectMovement script to the GameObject you want to move towards.

Step 6: Testing the Movement
- Press the Play button in Unity and observe how the object moves towards the target.

That's it! You've created a simple script that allows an object to move towards another object in Unity.
