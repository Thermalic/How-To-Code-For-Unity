Step 1: Setting up the Scene
- Open Unity and create a new 3D project.

Step 2: Creating the Script
- Right-click in the Project panel, then go to Create > C# Script.
- Name the script "HaloRotation" and double-click it to open in your code editor.

Step 3: Writing the Script
- Inside the HaloRotation script, create the following variables under the { :
```c#
using UnityEngine;

public class HaloRotation : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float rotationSpeed = 50f; // Adjust the rotation speed as needed
}
```

Step 4: Creating The Rotation Part

You might notice this under your variable
```c#
void Start().
```
Hover your mouse over the "Start" Text.
Then Delete the Start Text.
Once deleted replace the Start with:
```c#
void Update() 
```
Instead. This will constantly do something each frame.

Step 5: Adding the Rotation Logic

Now your script should look something like this.
```c#
using UnityEngine;

public class HaloRotation : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float rotationSpeed = 50f; // Adjust the rotation speed as needed

    void Update()
    {
    
    }
}
```
Inside the Update() method, type in the following code:
```c#
transform.Rotate(Vector3.up * rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
```
This will continuously rotate the object around its Y-axis at the specified speed.

Your script should now look like this:
```c#
using UnityEngine;

public class HaloRotation : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float rotationSpeed = 50f; // Adjust the rotation speed as needed

    void Update()
    {
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up * rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

Step 6: Saving 
- Save the script by pressing the save button, usually on the top or a file icon button.

Step 7: Attaching the Script
- Attach the HaloRotation script to the object you want to rotate like a halo in the Inspector panel.

Step 8: Testing the Rotation
- Press the Play button in Unity and observe how the object rotates like a halo.

That's it! You've created a simple script that allows an object to rotate like a halo in Unity.
